                            <h2>HIKING</h2>
                            
                            <p>For many visitors, Sri Lanka is all about blissful, blonde beaches, but another 
                                world awaits in the rugged, mountainous interior. It was only when railways 
                                were built through the highlands that vehicles replaced hiking as the main 
                                way of getting around this stunning tropical island. Modern-day trekkers can 
                                enter a wonderland of rugged ruins, sacred sites, epic viewpoints and 
                                tumbling tea estates, within easy striking distance of the coast.
                                
                                
                                With Sri Lanka's manageable scale – the island measures just 268 miles long 
                                by 139 miles wide – there are few complicated logistics for hikers to worry 
                                about. You’ll need a guide for walks in national parks (and off-the-beatentrack treks elsewhere) but most trips are easy day hikes, so you can turn up 
                                and start walking, safe in the knowledge that there'll be a filling plate of rice 
                                and curry waiting at your guesthouse at the end of a satisfying day of 
                                hiking</p>

                                things to do in Sri Lanka and when it came to deciding what safari in Sri

                                life a little easier, a guide covering all you need to know about safaris in Sri 
                                Lanka and highlighting the best safaris in Sri Lanka would be pretty useful.
